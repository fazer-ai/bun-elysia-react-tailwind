# GitHub Copilot Instructions

- Only add comments when strictly necessary. Never include obvious and redundant comments.
- Comments should always have a tag such as `// TODO:`, `// NOTE:`, or `// FIXME:` to indicate their purpose.
- "fazer.ai" should always be styled as "fazer.ai" (all lowercase). In specific cases, "fazer-ai" is acceptable as well. Never use "Fazer.ai" or "Fazer.AI".
- Always update localization keys when adding or modifying user-facing text.
- Always consider UX for backend requests: loading states, debouncing, error handling, and user feedback.
